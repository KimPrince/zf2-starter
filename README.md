Starter Application
=======================

Introduction
------------
This is a starting point for applications with complex business logic. It is a PHP MVC skeleton with a
Domain (Domain Model), Data Mapper and Service Layer. It uses Zend Framework 2 (ZF2)
however may be ported to other frameworks quite easily. You are welcome to use it as the foundation for
your next application.

Installation
------------

To get started using the 'quick' method:

1. Download the zip from github
2. Extract the zip to where your virtual hosts are set up
3. Run a composer update to get vendor dependencies
4. Create a virtual host that points to the public directory

When you browse your virtual host you should see a page welcoming you to the Starter Application.
